# Getting the final training dataset

This folder contains all the scripts and software used to get the final dataset. 

The main steps can be divided into:
1. a processing pipeline for quality improvement on crowdsourced datasets
2. a PII removal tool for the Common Crawl subset
3. tools used to convert the datasets to `jsonl` format in ordeer to feed to Megatron-DeepSpeed preprocessing scripts
