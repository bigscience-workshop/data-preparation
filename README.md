# Data prepation

This repository contains all the tools and code used to build the ROOTS dataset produced by the BigScience initiative to train the BLOOM models as well as a reduced version to train the tokenizer.

## General pipeline for the preparation of the ROOTS dataset

More detail on the process, including the specifics of the *cleaning*, *filtering*, and *deduplication* operations, can be found in Sections 2 "(Crowd)Sourcing a Language Resource Catalogue" and 3 "Processing OSCAR" of our paper [on the ROOTS dataset creation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=UoEw6KigkUn).
